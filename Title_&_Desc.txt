DA-AT-VFI
(Domain-Adaptive, Arbitrary-Timestep Video Frame Interpolation)

A deployable, arbitrary-resolution, domain-adapted VFI system
with controllable temporal interpolation, validated on large-scale
deformable-motion imagery.

A curriculum-trained, domain-adaptive VFI system that generalizes
across rigid, semi-rigid, and deformable motion regimes, while
supporting arbitrary resolution and arbitrary timestep
interpolation.
