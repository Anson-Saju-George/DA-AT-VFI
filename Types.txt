# 1️⃣ Domain Token Conditioning (Baseline Fix)

**Problem it solves:**
Your model treats Vimeo, X4K, and WMS like the same physics. That’s dumb — they’re not.

### What it is

Add a **learned embedding per dataset**:

```
d ∈ {vimeo, x4k, wms} → e_d
```

Inject it via FiLM or concat into feature maps:

```
F' = γ(e_d) ⊙ F + β(e_d)
```

### Effect

* Stops domain collapse
* Stabilizes training
* Free performance

### Difficulty

🟢 Easy

### Cost

Almost zero

# 2️⃣ Dual Motion Heads (Rigid vs Deformable)

**Problem it solves:**
One motion model cannot serve both buildings and smoke.

### What it is

Two parallel interpolation branches:

```
RigidHead(F)
DeformableHead(F)
```

Blend them later.

### Effect

* Sharp edges stay sharp
* Soft motion stops ghosting

### Difficulty

🟡 Medium

### Cost

~1.6× compute

# 3️⃣ Global Physics Token (Lookahead Lite)

**Problem it solves:**
Ambiguous motion from 2 frames.

### What it is

Use 3–4 frames → classify scene physics → scalar gate `p`

```
p = PhysicsHead(I0,I1,I2,I3)
Out = p*Deformable + (1-p)*Rigid
```

### Effect

* Huge stability jump
* Better cross-domain behavior

### Difficulty

🟡 Medium

### Cost

Small

# 4️⃣ Per-Pixel Physics Map (Real Separation)

**Problem it solves:**
Mixed scenes (car + rain + clouds)

### What it is

Predict a **physics mask**:

```
P(x,y)
```

Controls blending per pixel.

### Effect

* Surgical precision
* Research-tier output

### Difficulty

🔴 Hard

### Cost

High memory + training complexity

# 5️⃣ Temporal Consistency Head (Self-Supervised Physics)

**Problem it solves:**
No labels for deformability.

### What it is

Add a head that predicts:

```
E2 ≈ 2*E1 - E0
```

Train it to measure linearity of motion.

### Effect

* Physics-aware gating
* Generalizes across datasets

### Difficulty

🔴 Hard

### Cost

Extra training instability risk

---

# 6️⃣ Temporal Transformer Backbone (Elite Tier)

**Problem it solves:**
CNNs don’t “understand time”. They react to it.

### What it is

Patchify frames → tokens →
**Temporal Self-Attention across frames**

### Effect

* Long-range motion reasoning
* Lookahead + physics + domain all unified

### Difficulty

⚫ Brutal

### Cost

VRAM-eater. Slow. Beautiful.
